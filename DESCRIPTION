Description: The "LinearRegHandler" package is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed 
             to simplify the management and analysis of linear regression models in the 
             R programming environment. This package provides essential functionalities for
             performing linear regression analysis easily and flexibly.
             Basic features
             * Linear Algebra Foundation
                   LinearRegHandler uses the principles of linear algebra to create a solid
                   foundation for handling linear regression models. This ensures accurate 
                   and efficient calculations.
             * Object-oriented system
                   The package implements an intuitive object-oriented system, allowing users
                   to seamlessly interact with regression models. It includes specialized functions
                   such as print(), plot(), resid(), pred(), coef(), and summary(), enabling users 
                   to explore and visualize results effortlessly.
             * Vignettes for guidance
                   LinearRegHandler comes complete with a comprehensive vignette that serves as a 
                   step-by-step guide. It demonstrates how to effectively use the package to perform
                   simple regression analyses. Additionally, vignettes demonstrate the package's 
                   capabilities using a sample data set.
            This package streamlines the process of working with linear regression models, making it
            accessible to both beginners and experienced data analysts. Whether you need to fit a model,
            extract coefficients, generate predictions, or visualize results, LinearRegHandler simplifies
            the workflow, saving you time and effort.
